# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: November 5, 2025**

This Privacy Policy describes how Simply Taskful collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our mobile application.

## Information We Collect

We collect the following types of information:

- Task information (titles, descriptions, due dates, priorities)
- Category information you create
- Account information (name, email address)
- Device information for notifications
- Calendar event information (if you enable calendar import): event titles, descriptions, dates, and times
- Keyword filtering preferences (keywords you add to filter calendar events)

## How We Use Your Information

We use your information for the following purposes:

- To provide and maintain the Simply Taskful service
- To send you task reminders and daily summaries
- To organize your tasks by categories
- To import calendar events as tasks (if enabled)
- To filter calendar events based on your keyword preferences
- To improve our app functionality

## Calendar Access

If you enable calendar import, the app will access your iOS calendar to import events as tasks. Calendar access is optional and can be enabled or disabled at any time in Settings. We only access calendar events that you have permission to view. Calendar data is used solely to create tasks in the app and is not shared with third parties. Your calendar import history is stored securely to prevent duplicate imports.

## Data Storage and Security

Your data is encrypted in transit and at rest using industry-standard security measures. We use Firebase for secure data storage and authentication. Task data, categories, keywords, and calendar import history are stored in Firebase Firestore. Calendar access permissions are managed through iOS system settings and can be revoked at any time.

## Your Rights

You can delete your account and all associated data at any time through the Account Settings. You can also delete individual tasks or categories as needed.

## Contact Us

If you have any questions about how we handle your data or privacy, please contact us directly. We take privacy seriously and will address all concerns promptly.
