# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 2025**

This Privacy Policy describes how Simply Taskful collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our mobile application.

## Local Mode and Cloud Sync

Simply Taskful offers two modes of operation:

**Local Mode:** You can use the app without creating an account. In this mode, all your data (tasks, categories, keywords, and calendar import history) is stored locally on your device. No data is sent to our servers, and no account is required. Your data remains private and is only accessible on your device.

**Cloud Mode:** When you create an account, your data is synced to Firebase (our cloud storage provider) to enable access across multiple devices and provide backup functionality. You can switch between local and cloud modes at any time. When switching from local to cloud mode, your local data will be migrated to the cloud. When switching from cloud to local mode, your cloud data will be copied to local storage.

## Information We Collect

We collect the following types of information:

- Task information (titles, descriptions, due dates, priorities)
- Category information you create
- Account information (name, email address) - only when you create an account
- Device information for notifications
- Calendar event information (if you enable calendar import): event titles, descriptions, dates, and times
- Keyword filtering preferences (keywords you add to filter calendar events)

**Note:** In Local Mode, all information is stored only on your device and is not collected by us.

## How We Use Your Information

We use your information for the following purposes:

- To provide and maintain the Simply Taskful service
- To send you task reminders and daily summaries
- To organize your tasks by categories
- To import calendar events as tasks (if enabled)
- To filter calendar events based on your keyword preferences
- To improve our app functionality

## Calendar Access

If you enable calendar import, the app will access your iOS calendar to import events as tasks. Calendar access is optional and can be enabled or disabled at any time in Settings. We only access calendar events that you have permission to view. Calendar data is used solely to create tasks in the app and is not shared with third parties. Your calendar import history is stored securely to prevent duplicate imports.

## Data Storage and Security

**Local Mode:** When using the app in Local Mode, all your data is stored locally on your device using iOS's standard storage mechanisms. Your data is not transmitted to any servers and remains private on your device.

**Cloud Mode:** When you create an account and use Cloud Mode, your data is encrypted in transit and at rest using industry-standard security measures. We use Firebase for secure data storage and authentication. Task data, categories, keywords, and calendar import history are stored in Firebase Firestore. Your data is protected by Firebase's security infrastructure and is only accessible to you through your authenticated account.

Calendar access permissions are managed through iOS system settings and can be revoked at any time, regardless of which mode you're using.

## Your Rights

**Local Mode:** You have full control over your data. You can delete individual tasks or categories at any time. To remove all local data, you can uninstall the app or use the "Exit Local Mode" option, which will clear all local data.

**Cloud Mode:** You can delete your account and all associated data at any time through the Account Settings. You can also delete individual tasks or categories as needed. When you delete your account, all data stored in Firebase will be permanently deleted.
